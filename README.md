# Foreign Exchange Futures Converter
The global foreign exchange market accounts for over $5 trillion U.S. dollars worth of average daily trading volume, making it the largest market in the world.  Within this market, there is a growing class of derivative securities: foreign exchange futures.  It is quite common to access the spot and forward markets for better liquidity when trading futures, but this requires the simultaneous conversion of price and contract size from futures into spot or vice versa.

The primary goal of this project is to allow users to efficiently and accurately price foreign exchange futures given a forward rate and contract size.

Once all the above is input, only the bid on the outright will need to be updated with changes in price.  The futures price and futures spread will automatically update.

With an increase in the outright price, futures is inversely affected.

## Disclaimer
Trading and investing in the foreign exchange market involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.  The valuation of currencies and futures may fluctuate, and, as a result, you may lose more than your original investment.  The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.

If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account.
