# Foreign Exchange Futures Converter
The global foreign exchange market accounts for over $5 trillion U.S. dollars worth of average daily trading volume, making it the largest market in the world.  Within this market, there is a growing class of derivative securities: foreign exchange futures.  It is quite common to access the spot and forward markets for better liquidity when trading futures, but this requires the simultaneous conversion of price and contract size from futures into spot or vice versa.

The primary goal of this project is to allow users to efficiently and accurately price foreign exchange futures given a forward price and contract size.
